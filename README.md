# QuizApp

This Android app is part of the Udacity lesson 12 project and Andela Learning Community (ALC) #7DaysofCodeChallenge. 

The aim of the project is to “create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice”.

This app is a quiz about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It tests the user’s knowledge of the various films and characters of the MCU.

There are six questions in total. The final score (out of 10) is displayed via a toast message with a list of all the questions that were answered incorrectly.

The first three questions contain radio buttons and are worth one point each. The fourth question is a list of checkboxes; the two correctly selected checkboxes are worth one point each. The remaining two questions are Edit TextViews that require the user to type the answers into it. The first Edit Textview (question 5) is worth two points and the last one (question 6) is worth three points.

Each question is validated such as: are all the questions answered, which question is not answered and did the user select the correct number of check boxes.
